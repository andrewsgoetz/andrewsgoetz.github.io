    <h1>Andrew Goetz</h1>
    <p>This is my personal website. I am a software engineer in the aerospace industry. My background is in pure
        mathematics, which I still love, but over the years I have slowly transitioned to the applied realm in my
        professional life.</p>
    <h2>Software</h2>
    <h3>GitHub</h3>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/andrewsgoetz">I am on GitHub.</a></p> My repositories include:
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewsgoetz/penrose-turing">penrose-turing</a> - A command-line tool written in
            C which executes Penrose-style Turing machines as described in <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> by Roger
            Penrose.</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewsgoetz/poinsot">poinsot</a> - An animation of the motion of a torque-free
            top and the Poinsot construction. <a href="poinsot/poinsot.html">See the animation here!</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/andrewsgoetz/spacetrack-report-no-3">spacetrack-report-no-3</a> - Fortran code
            from the paper <i>Spacetrack Report No. 3: Models for Propagation of NORAD Element Sets</i> by Hoots and
            Roehrich, which is the origin of the algorithms used to propagate satellite two-line element sets today.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Open Source Contributions</h3>
    <p>I have contributed improvements and bugfixes to <a href="https://hipparchus.org/">Hipparchus</a> (a Java math
        library) and <a href="">Orekit</a> (a space dynamics library).</p>
    <h2>Textbook Notes/Solutions</h2>
    <p>One of my hobbies is reading through a math or physics textbook and trying to do all the exercises. I have a
        substantial library of notes, solved problems, and software routines that I've written for my own benefit. Once
        I've written the solution to a problem down, it prevents me from feeling like I need to solve it again later.
        Also, writing helps to clarify my thinking. I don't post most of my notes and solutions on the web, but here
        are the exceptions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>What is Mathematics?</i> (Second Edition) by Courant, Robbins, and Stewart
            <ul>
                <li><a href="textbooks/courant_robbins/courant_robbins_p354.html">Elliptic billiards (p354)</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
